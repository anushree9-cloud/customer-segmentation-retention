# Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation and retention analysis using unsupervised and basic supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify high-value and at-risk users, and derive actionable insights to improve customer retention.

The entire analysis is implemented in a single Jupyter notebook and follows an end-to-end data science workflow.
